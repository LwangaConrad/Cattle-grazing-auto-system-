# Cattle-grazing-auto-system-
This is an automated cattle grazing system designed during my embedded systems course
The system has;
A 7 segment display to register the number of hours the cattle have been grazing,
A keypad to open the paddocks 1 through 4 or 0 for all,
An lcd to keep track of the status of the paddocks main doors,
A buzzer that sounds when the time for grazing or for drinking water is up,
and Red and Green leds to represent each of the paddocks,
When the door is opened the cows move into the paddock, graze for 4 minutes, then move to the water subdivision and drink for two minutes before going back to the grazing paddock where they spend another 3 minutes and finally return to the resting area
Though the pattern is repeatable the 7 segment display will reset the count after each cycle
